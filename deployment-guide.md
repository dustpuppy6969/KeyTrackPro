# KeyTrack Pro: Complete Deployment Guide for Android Users

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your key tracking application using only your Android phone and free services. This guide assumes you have no prior technical experience.

## 1. Setting Up Your Supabase Database

You've already completed this step by providing your DATABASE_URL. The connection is working properly. Here's what happened:

1. Your Supabase database is now connected to the application
2. The schema for storing keys, verifications, and settings has been created
3. The application can now store and retrieve data from Supabase

## 2. Deploy Your App Using Netlify (Free & Easy Method)

Even with just your Android phone, you can deploy this app using Netlify's free tier:

1. **Create a GitHub Account**:
   - Open your browser and go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Tap "Sign Up" and follow the instructions to create an account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Fork This Repository**:
   - In your GitHub account, create a new repository
   - Name it "key-track-pro" or anything you prefer
   - Use the "Import code" option to import this repository

3. **Create a Netlify Account**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) on your phone browser
   - Sign up using your GitHub account (tap "Sign up with GitHub")
   - Complete the account setup process

4. **Deploy Your App**:
   - In Netlify dashboard, tap "New site from Git"
   - Select GitHub as your Git provider
   - Authorize Netlify to access your repositories
   - Select your "key-track-pro" repository
   - Set the following:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Expand "Advanced build settings" and add:
     - Key: `DATABASE_URL`
     - Value: (paste your Supabase connection string)
   - Tap "Deploy site"

5. **Access Your App**:
   - Once deployment is complete (usually takes 1-3 minutes)
   - Netlify will provide a URL like `your-site-name.netlify.app`
   - Open this URL on your Android phone to access your app

## 3. Run the Database Migrations

Before using your app, you need to initialize the database:

1. **Using Netflify's Function Console**:
   - In your Netlify dashboard, go to "Functions"
   - Create a new function (we'll use this to run migrations)
   - Paste the contents of our schema-push.js file
   - Run the function to initialize your database

## 4. Using Your App

Now that your app is deployed and the database is initialized, you can start using it:

1. **Adding Keys**:
   - Go to the Keys tab
   - Tap the + button
   - Enter the key details (number, location, description)
   - Save the key

2. **Generating QR Codes**:
   - In the Keys list, tap the QR code icon next to a key
   - The QR code will be generated
   - You can print this QR code and attach it to your physical key

3. **Scanning Keys**:
   - Go to the Scan tab
   - Allow camera permissions when prompted
   - Scan a key's QR code
   - The app will record the verification

4. **Configuring Settings**:
   - Go to the Admin tab
   - Configure verification frequency, alerts, and other settings
   - Settings will be saved to your device

## 5. Updating Your App

If you make changes to the app code, you can easily update your deployment:

1. Update your code in GitHub
2. Netlify will automatically detect changes and redeploy
3. Your app will be updated without losing any data

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **App Not Working**:
   - Check that your DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Ensure database migrations ran successfully
   - Try clearing your browser cache

2. **Camera Not Working**:
   - Ensure you've granted camera permissions
   - Try using the manual key entry option as a workaround

3. **Database Issues**:
   - Visit your Supabase dashboard to check your database
   - Ensure the tables are created correctly

## Next Steps

Once your app is running, consider these enhancements:

1. Add user authentication for multi-user support
2. Implement email notifications for missing keys
3. Create custom QR code designs for your organization
4. Set up automated reports and analytics
